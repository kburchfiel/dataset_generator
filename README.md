# dataset_generator
A tool for creating fictional data in Python for data analytics practice

In this program, I use Python to create a fictional dataset showing the results of a happiness survey with 1600 participants. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a 'clean' and public-domain set of data for data analytics practice. (The code that creates the dataset is released under the MIT license.)

Please see the .ipynb file for more information.
